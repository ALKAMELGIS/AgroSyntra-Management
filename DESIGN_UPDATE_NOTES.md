# Design refresh — November 2026

All features, routes, roles and data flows are unchanged. Visual / UX changes only.

## Fixed
- **Broken responsive grids (50 files):** pages used the MUI v5 `<Grid item xs md>` API, which MUI v7 ignores, so cards and form columns sized to their content instead of the grid. All converted to `size={{…}}`.
- **Dark mode:** `App.css` forced light colours with `!important` on the app bar, sidebar, cards and inputs. Now everything follows the theme; the "System" theme follows OS changes live; browser chrome colour follows the mode.
- **Arabic / RTL crash:** prevented a crash of every text field in Arabic.
- **Clipped headers on phones:** page headers with action buttons (Templates, Harvest dashboard, Efficiency, Users, …) now wrap instead of pushing buttons off-screen.
- Unified colours: mixed blue / navy / green Excel-import headers, indigo accents and old greens all mapped to the brand tokens.
- Double padding in Manpower pages; GIS map full-bleed now matches the new gutter.

## New
- Unified design system (`src/theme.js`, see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`).
- Subtle background moon (`BackgroundMoon`), also on the auth screens.
- Redesigned app shell: translucent blurred top bar, pill search, account menu, calmer sidebar with an active indicator, workspace tabs.
- Redesigned Home / area hubs, dashboard section cards, KPI cards, Daily Brief sections, and Login.
- Inter + IBM Plex Sans Arabic, loaded once with preconnect (removed the render-blocking CSS `@import`).
- Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`; visible keyboard focus rings; 44px menu items on phones.
