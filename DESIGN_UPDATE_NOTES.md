# Design refresh — November 2026

All features, routes, roles and data flows are unchanged. Visual / UX changes only.

## Fixed
- **Broken responsive grids (50 files):** pages used the MUI v5 `<Grid item xs md>` API, which MUI v7 ignores, so cards and form columns sized to their content instead of the grid. All converted to `size={{…}}`.
- **Dark mode:** `App.css` forced light colours with `!important` on the app bar, sidebar, cards and inputs. Now everything follows the theme; the "System" theme follows OS changes live; browser chrome colour follows the mode.
- **Arabic / RTL crash:** prevented a crash of every text field in Arabic.
- **Clipped headers on phones:** page headers with action buttons (Templates, Harvest dashboard, Efficiency, Users, …) now wrap instead of pushing buttons off-screen.
- Unified colours: mixed blue / navy / green Excel-import headers, indigo accents and old greens all mapped to the brand tokens.
- Double padding in Manpower pages; GIS map full-bleed now matches the new gutter.

## New
- Unified design system (`src/theme.js`, see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`).
- Redesigned app shell: translucent blurred top bar, pill search, account menu, calmer sidebar with an active indicator, workspace tabs.
- Redesigned Home / area hubs, dashboard section cards, KPI cards, Daily Brief sections, and Login.
- Inter + IBM Plex Sans Arabic, loaded once with preconnect (removed the render-blocking CSS `@import`).
- Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`; visible keyboard focus rings; 44px menu items on phones.

## Round 2
- Removed the background moon completely (component, app shell, login and auth pages).
- Icon family unified: 138 files switched to Material *Outlined* icons (semantic pairs such as star/checkbox left untouched).
- Language switcher: inline English | العربية segmented control in the account menu (no emoji flags, clear label).
- Tabs now scroll with arrows instead of being clipped on narrow screens (theme default).
- Select fields with an empty option no longer overlap their label (Organization Settings).
- Tasks board shows 3 columns from tablet width; sidebar site selector matches the season selector.

## Round 3 — built for daily staff use
- **Breadcrumb trail on every page** (Home › Area › Section › Page) generated from the navigation config (`src/config/pageMeta.js`, `components/PageContextBar.js`). Area links back to its module hub.
- **Phone bottom navigation** (Home · Modules · Search · Alerts · Menu) for one-thumb use in the field; snackbars and pinned bars are lifted above it.
- **"Continue where you left off"** on Home: the last 6 opened pages for this browser, filtered by the user's current role.
- **Fixed scroll-region heights**: pages never knew the area-tabs row was visible, so spreadsheets/maps overflowed by 44px. The shell now shares this via `AppChromeContext`; the GIS map fits the screen exactly.
- Page titles normalized to the theme weights (removed ad-hoc 700/800 weights and oversize h4 overrides in 50 pages).
